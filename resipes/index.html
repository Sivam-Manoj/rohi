                                    1. Marinate the chicken with yogurt, red chili powder, turmeric powder, and salt. Let it marinate for at least 1-2 hours.<br>
                                    
                                    2 In a large pot, heat oil or ghee. Add sliced onions and fry until golden brown. Remove half of the fried onions for garnishing.
                                    <br>
                                    
                                    3 Add ginger-garlic paste to the remaining onions in the pot and sauté until the raw smell disappears.<br>
                                    
                                    4 Add chopped tomatoes, biryani masala, and green chilies. Cook until the tomatoes are soft.<br>
                                    
                                    5 Add marinated chicken to the pot and cook until the chicken is partially cooked.<br>
                                    
                                   6  Meanwhile, parboil the soaked basmati rice with some whole spices until it's 70-80% cooked. Drain the water.<br>
                                    
                                    7 Layer the partially cooked chicken with mint leaves, coriander leaves, and half of the fried onions.<br>
                                    
                                    8 Top the chicken layer with the parboiled rice. Sprinkle some biryani masala, mint leaves, coriander leaves, and the remaining fried onions.
                                    <br>
                                    9 Mix saffron strands in warm milk and drizzle it over the rice for a fragrant and colorful touch.<br>
                                    
                                   10  Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid or seal it with dough to trap the steam.<br>
                                    
                                   11  Cook on low heat for about 25-30 minutes or until the chicken is fully cooked, and the rice is tender.<br>
                                    
                                    12 Gently fluff the biryani with a fork, ensuring not to break the rice grains.<br>
                                    
                                    13 Serve the flavorful Hyderabad Chicken Biryani hot with raita or a side salad. Enjoy your delicious homemade biryani!</P>

                                            1 . Marinate the Chicken:<br>

                                            Place the chicken pieces in a bowl.
                                            Pour enough buttermilk over the chicken to completely submerge it.
                                            Cover the bowl and let it marinate in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours or overnight. The acidity in the buttermilk helps tenderize the chicken.
                                            <br>
                                            2. Prepare the Coating:<br>

                                            In a separate bowl, mix the all-purpose flour, cornstarch, salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne pepper (if using). Adjust the seasonings to taste.
                                            <br>
                                            3. Coat the Chicken:<br>

                                            Heat the oil in a deep fryer or a large, deep pan to around 350-375°F (175-190°C).
                                            Take each piece of chicken from the buttermilk, letting excess drip off, and coat it thoroughly with the flour mixture. Press the flour mixture onto the chicken to ensure a crispy coating.
                                            <br>
                                            4. Fry the Chicken:<br>

                                            Carefully place the coated chicken into the hot oil. Fry a few pieces at a time to avoid overcrowding the pan.
                                            Fry until the chicken is golden brown and cooked through. The internal temperature should reach 165°F (74°C).
                                            Remove the fried chicken from the oil and place it on a wire rack to drain excess oil.
                                            <br>

                                            Let the chicken rest for a few minutes before serving. This allows the juices to redistribute, keeping the chicken moist.
                                            Serve your crispy fried chicken with your favorite sides, like coleslaw, mashed potatoes, or a dipping sauce. Enjoy your delicious homemade fried chicken

                                    1. For the Cake:<br><br>
                                    Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans. <br>
                                    In a large mixing bowl, sift together flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and baking soda. <br>
                                    Add sugar, eggs, milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract to the dry ingredients. Mix until well combined. <br>
                                    Gradually add boiling water to the batter, mixing continuously. The batter will be thin, but that's okay. <br>
                                    Pour the batter evenly into the prepared cake pans. <br>
                                    Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. <br>
                                    Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely. <br><br>
                                    2. For the Frosting: <br> <br>
                                    In a large bowl, beat the softened butter until creamy. <br>
                                    Sift in cocoa powder and add powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla extract. Beat until smooth and creamy. <br>
                                    If the frosting is too thick, you can add more milk; if it's too thin, add more powdered sugar. <br> <br>
                                    3. Assembling the Cake: <br><br>
                                    Once the cakes are completely cooled, place one cake layer on a serving plate. <br>
                                    Spread a layer of chocolate frosting on top of the first layer. <br>
                                    Place the second cake layer on top and frost the top and sides of the entire cake with the remaining frosting. <br>
                                    You can decorate the cake with additional chocolate shavings, sprinkles, or berries if desired. <br> 
                                    Slice and enjoy your delicious homemade chocolate cake! <br>

                                        1. Prepare the Filling:<br>
                                        Heat oil in a pan. Add cumin seeds and let them splutter.<br>
                                        Add grated ginger, minced green chilies, and sauté for a minute.<br>
                                        Add turmeric powder, ground coriander, garam masala, and sauté for another minute.<br>
                                        Add boiled and mashed potatoes, boiled peas, amchur, salt, and mix well.<br>
                                        Cook the mixture for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally.<br>
                                        Add chopped fresh coriander leaves, mix, and let the filling cool.<br>
                                        2. Make the Dough:<br>
                                        In a bowl, mix the all-purpose flour, salt, and oil or ghee. <br>
                                        Gradually add water and knead to form a smooth, firm dough. <br>
                                        Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes.<br>
                                        3. Assemble and Fry the Samosas:<br><br>
                                        Divide the dough into equal portions and roll each portion into a ball. <br>
                                        Roll each ball into a thin oval or round shape. <br>
                                        Cut the rolled dough in half to form two semi-circles. <br>                                           
                                        Take one semi-circle, create a cone shape, and seal the edges with a water-flour paste to form a cone. <br>
                                        Fill the cone with the prepared potato-peas filling and seal the open edge to form a triangular shape. <br>
                                        Heat oil for deep frying in a pan. <br>                                
                                        Fry the samosas on medium heat until they turn golden brown and crispy. <br>
                                        Remove the samosas and place them on paper towels to absorb excess oil. <br>                        
                                        Serve the crispy samosas with mint chutney or tamarind sauce. Enjoy your delicious homemade samosas! <br>
